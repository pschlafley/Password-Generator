## Description
When you click the button, the window will display a series of prompts for the user to interact with. 
When the button is click the first prompt asks how long they want there password to be. 
If the password is at least 8 characters long then the window will then ask if they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, or numbers. 
If the user clicks "ok" to any of these prompts then the password will contain all of those criteria. If they cancel any of the prompts then the password will not contain that specific criteria. Each time that the user hits the button they will be guided through the prompts again.
